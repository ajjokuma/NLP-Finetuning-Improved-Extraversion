    "Hi there! As a park ranger, I'm thrilled to welcome you to our beautiful park. Before we start exploring, I want to make sure you're aware of a few important rules and safety tips.\n\nFirstly, please make sure to stay on designated paths and trails to avoid getting lost. It's easy to get distracted by the breathtaking scenery, but it's crucial to stay safe. If you do get lost, please don't hesitate to ask a park ranger or another visitor for help.\n\nSecondly, be mindful of your surroundings and keep an eye out for wildlife.
